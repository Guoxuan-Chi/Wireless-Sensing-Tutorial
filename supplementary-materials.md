[**Sensing Dataset Platform (SDP)**](http://sdp8.net/) is initiated by ISAC-ETI and collaboratively developed and operated by relevant professional organizations and individuals from both the industrial and academic sectors. The platform aims to provide rich scenarios, extensive use cases, and abundant high-quality sensing datasets to support AI model training and algorithm research in the field of sensing. This endeavor is geared towards advancing the construction of AI and algorithm capabilities in sensing, ultimately driving breakthroughs in key sensing technologies and collectively building a bright future for the sensing industry.

[**Widar3.0**](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/widar3.0/) is a Wi-Fi gesture recognition dataset provided by the Tsinghua MobiSense Group. It contains channel state information (CSI) collected from commercial Wi-Fi cards, and the corresponding Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) and Body-coordinate Velocity Profile (BVP). The dataset consists of 258K gesture instances, with a total collecting time of 8,620 minutes, from 75 different combinations of users, environments, and device placements.&#x20;

## Reading List

To provide a solid foundation for those new to the field of wireless sensing, we are excited to introduce a Reading List in our tutorial. This section will feature a carefully curated list of entry-level papers that illuminate the latest advancements and foundational concepts in wireless sensing. These selections are chosen to help beginners grasp the key ideas and methodologies in an accessible manner, facilitating a smoother entry into this dynamic field. We believe that this reading list will serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of wireless sensing technologies and their applications.
